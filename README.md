# Sudoku

##### I had a super original idea for an app... Sudoko. I really just wanted to get to work with deploying to Heroku so I put a lot less thought into an idea for an App and went with Sudoku which has been created many a time. With that being said, Sudoku inherently has some pretty interesting problems and turning the game play of Sudoku into a Full Stack web application was very interesting to me.
